# Solarized for Xcode 4

Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors)
designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several [unique
properties](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized#features). [[Ethan Schoonover]](http://ethanschoonover.com/colophon)
designed this colorscheme with both precise
[CIELAB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space) lightness relationships
and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been
tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as
uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting
conditions.

## Usage

Just copy both **.dvtcolortheme** files to **~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes**

*Note: you have to restart Xcode in order to load the new themes*
